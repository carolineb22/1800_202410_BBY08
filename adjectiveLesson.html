   <p>Today and I went to the shelter to find a cat to adopt. An attendant showed me the available cats and
    I was amazed at what I saw. There was a <b>hiyí</b> fluffy cat who was gobboling down his breakfast, so <b>esḵénaxw</b>!
    In the cage right beside it was a very <b>etsím</b> kitten. I was afraid talking to loud would scare it away as it was so tiny
    and frail. But it walked straight up to the bars of it's cage and stuck it's head straight through the <b>eḵwís</b> bars to meowed at me! The third cat was a senior, 14 years old 
    and he had been at the shelter for a year already! When I approached his cage he stood up, stretched and came to the bars, 
    showing off how <b>nach’ím̓</b> he was.
