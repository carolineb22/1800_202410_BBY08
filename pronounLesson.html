    <p>Today was so fun! <b>Chen</b> went out to the park with my friends, <b>chet</b> had a picnic and got to share
        delicious snacks! <b>I7x̱w swat</b> had such a fun time! <b>Chet</b> played games and talked for hours. Finally Alex and Amanda
        said they had to leave so we gave them some leftover cupcakes and said goodbye. <b>Kwétsiw̓it</b> texted us half an hour later
        saying Alex forgot his jackets so <b>chen</b> drove by their house to give it back.
