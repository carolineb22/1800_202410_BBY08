   <p>Do you know that <u>chen</u> saw <u>chexw</u> by the bus stand yesterday?
Me and my friends, <u>chet</u> were going to the mall, and then I recognized you. So,
I told them that I'll meet them, and so <u>kwétsiw̓it</u> left. I was like <u>ta new</u>
repeatedly to get your attention, but I don't think <u>chexw</u> heard.</p>
