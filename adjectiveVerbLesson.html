   <div class="examples"><h3>Words in Action</h3></div>
   <p> I wanted to <u>p’i7t</u> that thief, but we were in public. I didn't 
want to look foolish in front of everyone else, so I kept my composure. I dared not
<u>ḵ’ayt</u>; I was about to <u>huyá7</u>, but I noticed that people started to 
leave. I quickly thought to <u>kway</u> by the corner of a building, just a little
off of a <u>eḵwís</u> passage where the thief was. That <u>smáts’en</u> and <u>esḵénaxw</u>
face could not be mistaken. He was a <u>hiyí</u> fellow possessing <u>nach’ím̓</u> features, with
a <u>etsím</u> nose and mouth. Just when I leaned in closer to get a better view of him,
he noticed me from the corner of his eye, and he started to <u>kat</u> the building. I ran 
as fast as I could through the <u>eḵwís</u> passage, and when I reached the struggling thief, I went
to <u>ch’iin</u> him and throw him to the ground. We started to <u>kwílten</u>, and as we traded
blows, I saw him <u>éx̱wu7n</u> blood, which spattered on my face, all <u>kw'as</u>. </p>
