        <h3>Words in Action</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Sometimes when I need a break I take a walk to my local park. Today was one of those days, so I put on my coat and braced myself for the 
        <b>slhem̓xw</b> and <b>spahím̓</b>. The walk to the park is always nice, I get to say hi to my neighbor's dogs that have seemingly
        dragged their owners outside on this miserable night. But this is where I feel at peace. I look up at the <b>skwayl</b> to admire 
        the bright <b>kwúsen</b> I see every night. As I finally get to the park I see the most wonderful thing. 
        A <b>spáḵ’em</b> has broken through the first spring frost and is poking out to admire the <b>ḵ’eḵsín̓ ti siyátshen</b> with me.
