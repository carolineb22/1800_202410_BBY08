   <p>
    Tonight I'm in charge of making dinner for the family! I decided to make the <i>best</i> <b>slhum̓</b> my family has ever had!
    I started early, baking some <b>seplín</b> and made a spread with <b>sḵw’elám</b> I picked yesterday. The soup had a vegtable base.
    I used the carrots and potates we grew just outside, and too fill us up I made sure there was lots of <b>smeyts</b>. The <b>slhum̓</b> was
    ready so I went outside to call everyone in for dinner. Just then I caught a whiff of the neighbors dinner. Awh- now I wish I had <b>sḵ’ey̓</b>!
