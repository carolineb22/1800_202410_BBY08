        <h3>Words in Action</h3>

    <p>
        I grew up living with my <b>push</b> Charlie. To me Charlie was the coolest thing <i>ever</i>. But when 
        my parents started to take me out on hikes with them as I got older I learned about all the other animals in our world!
        If you watched the river closely sometimes you can see the <b>kwu7s</b> jumping through the rapids, or a <b>élhḵay̓</b> slithering their way through
        the tall grasses. They come in so many different colours it's amazing! At night I can hear the hoot of the <b>chíyatmixw</b> that lives in the 
        forest nearby. My dad says that he's looking for dinner, and his favourite thing to find is a little <b>kw’át’an</b>! Everyday I learn 
        more and more about the wonderful animals we share this earth with, but if you ask me, Charlie's still the coolest!
