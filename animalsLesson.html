   <p> I thought that my <u>push</u> was interesting until I embraced the outdoors. I wasn't aware of the majestic
<u>ch’ésḵen</u> gliding in the air with pride nor the observant <u>chíyatmixw</u> perched up on a branch, silently 
awaiting prey. The <u>élhḵay̓</u> in its cunningness slithers almost unseen in the meadows, looking to deceive the
unsuspecting <u>kw’át’an</u> or <u>hew̓ít</u>. The smaller and more evasive prey, the <u>ḵwen̓ímach</u>, attends its 
nightly dinner on the forearms of farmers tending cattle and other animals, such as the <u>kweshú</u>.</p>
