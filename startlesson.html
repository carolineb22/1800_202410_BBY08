    </div>
    <p>Today is Aiyana's birthday I am going to her house to celebrate! 
        First I get on the bus a say <b>"Nuuw"</b> to the bus driver. He smiles at me and 
        I go sit down. When I get off the bus I call out behind me <b>"Huy chexw a"</b>.
        I walk to her house and push open the back gate, <b>"I chen tl'iḵ!"</b> I call out to my bestfriend.
        She replies <b>"Nú"</b> and gives me a hug. "Happy birthday!" I say and hand her my gift. After many hours of
        fun it's finally time to leave and we say <b>"Huy̓ melh halh".</b>
