   <p> My <u>kwúpits</u>, Paul, refused to play with me, so I told on him to my <u>chésha7</u>. She grabbed him by the ear
    and scolded him. She then went back to the living room, where my <u>man</u> was listening to the news. She 
    complained to him that the <u>mén̓men</u> were a handful to manage to which he nodded in silent agreement. He then called
    my <u>si7l</u>, who agreed to take her naughty <u>ímats</u> for the day. Paul wasn't that sad when he heard
    the news. In fact, he smiled, because he got to hang out with his <u>kwepkwúpits</u>, who were much older than him,
    some of whom even had a <u>kwtams</u> or a <u>chewásh</u>. </p>
