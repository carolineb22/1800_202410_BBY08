        <h3>Words in Action</h3>
    </div>
    <p>This year we're having my <b>man</b>'s birthday dinner at my <b>kwúpits</b>'s house. This would be fine except a
        few months back I noticed that my <b>kwúpits</b> had blocked me on all social mendia platforms and blocked my phone number
        without saying anything to me. I love my <b>man</b> and don't want to miss his special day but I don't know what's happening with my <b>áyish</b>.
        I decided to call my <b>chésha7</b> to ask if she knew what had happened but she told me she doesn't know but that I should come anyways. 
        I hope my sister's <b>chewásh</b> isn't mad at me as well or this will be an awkward dinner!
